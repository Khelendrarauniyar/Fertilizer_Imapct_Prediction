            <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
            <h4>1. Fertilizer Impact Prediction System</h4>
            <p>
                A web-based application that predicts the impact of fertilizers on crops using Gemini API and machine learning models. 
                It provides data-driven insights for farmers, helping them optimize their crop yields and improve agricultural productivity.
            </p>

            <h4>2. AI Travel Planner (React Native)</h4>
            <p>
                A React Native application that assists users in planning their trips efficiently with location search, 
                activity recommendations, and seamless navigation. It integrates APIs for a superior user experience.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Lung Cancer Detection</h4>
            <p>
                An ML based model that is used to predict the chance of being infected by lung cancer. This model is basically build by some medical parameter that is considered as the main cause for lung cancer and infections.
